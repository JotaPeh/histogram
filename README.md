Histogram equalize and sampling in C for TIFF images

-- In order to use this codes, follow the steps bellow:

1 - Run "python3 subsamp.py ImageBand4.tif", it's going to generate the "acs_full_equal.tiff" and the "acs_half.tiff" files;

2 - Run "gcc -o subsamp subsamp.c" to generate the file "submap";

3 - Run "./subsamp ImageBand4.tif 200", or another number of this magnitude divisible by 20 to generate "acs_full_equal_C.bin" and "acs_half_C.bin";

4 - Finally, run "compare_image.py" to obtain "acs_full_equal_C.tiff" and the "acs_half_C.tiff" images and compare then with those generated by "subsamp.py";

5 - Run "recover_image" in order to only recover the images from their .bin, if you want to.
